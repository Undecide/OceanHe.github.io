US GEOTRACES GP17-OCE (Nov 13, 2022 to Jan 25, 2023)
======
- Determination the aerosol deposition rate, the surface ocean diffusion process, and the upper ocean ventilation in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean by measuring the natural radioisotope berlium-7 in the aerosol, rain and surface ocean profile (collaborated with Dr. William Landing and Dr. Cliff Buck).
- Determination of the air-sea exchange of inorganic and methylated mercury in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean. Quantifying the dissolved gaseous elemental and dimethylmercury (DMHg) as well as methylated and total mercury (collaborated with Dr. Carl Lamborg and Dr. Chad Hammerschmidt) in seawater column and measuring the elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>), reactive gaseous mercury (RGHg), particulate mercury (Hg<sup>P</sup>) in atmosphere.
- Developing an automatic pumping system for the in-situ berlium-7 collection in seawater.

US GEOTRACES GP15 (Sept 18 to Nov 24, 2018)
======
- Determination of the air-sea exchange of inorganic and methylated mercury in the anthropogenically-impacted and remote Pacific Ocean.
- Quantifying the dissolved methylated and total mercury (collaborated with Dr. Carl Lamborg and Dr. Chad Hammerschmidt) in seawater column.
- Measuring the elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>), reactive gaseous mercury (RGHg), particulate mercury (Hg<sup>P</sup>) in atmosphere along the PMT cruise.

Arctic Ocean Cruise (May 20 to June 14, 2021)
======
- Determination of the air-sea exchange of inorganic and methylated mercury from open water, through the marginal ice zone and into completely covered ice regions by measuring dissolved Hg<sup>0</sup> and dimethylmercury (DMHg) and atmospheric Hg speciation (Hg<sup>0</sup>, RGHg and Hg<sup>P</sup>).
- Quantifying the Hg<sup>0</sup> exchange rates by using the <sup>222</sup>Rn deficiency in the mixed layer with respect to its parent nuclide <sup>226</sup>Ra (collaborated with Dr. David Kadko).
- Collecting and incubating the sediment cores to determine the Hg species flux at sediment-water interface by using the <sup>224</sup>Ra/<sup>228</sup>Th disequilibrium approach (collaborated with Dr. Doug Hammond).
- Collecting the atmospheric precipitation and aerosol samples and performing on-board seawater incubation experiments during the Arctic cruise.

Long Island Sound long-term observation project (May 2018 to Nov 2022)
======
- Determining the air-sea exchange of inorganic mercury at the coast of Long Island Sound with high-resolution measurement.
- Developed a prototype auto-analyzer for determining DMHg flux at air-sea interface with the first “high-resolution measurement” in this world.
- Kept tracking the atmospheric Hg speciation (Hg<sup>0</sup>, RGHg and Hg<sup>P</sup>) associated with the environmental parameters.
